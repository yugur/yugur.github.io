# Online dictionary

## About

The Yugur Online Dictionary is an open-source project aiming to build a dictionary targeted at the preservation and research of indigenous and endangered languages. The project is split into two main parts: a React Web App and a Go RESTful API.

### Documentation

Now that the 2017 team has concluded work, **the most important source of documentation is the [Handover Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a)**. For anyone interested in assessing or continuing the project, it's recommended that you start here.

### Source

The source code for the Web App, RESTful API, Chinese Segmenter and information such as licensing, installation instructions and changelogs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/yugur).

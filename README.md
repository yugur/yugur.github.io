# About
The Yugur Online dictionary is an open-source project aiming to build a dictionary targeted at the preservation and research of indigenous and endangered languages. The project is currently split into two parts: a web app built with React.js and a RESTful API built in Go.

## Source
The source code and information such as licensing, installation instructions and changelogs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/yugur).

We use the [gitstats](http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/) tool to generate fancy looking data about the [Yugur RESTful API](api-stats/index.html) and the [Yugur Web App](app-stats/index.html). These pages are updated periodically.

## Development
Development is managed through a publicly accessible [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jMzGDNag/yugur-dictionary-app).

# Online dictionary

## About

The Yugur Online Dictionary is an open-source project aiming to build a dictionary targeted at the preservation and research of indigenous and endangered languages. The project is split into two main parts: a web app built with React and a RESTful API built with Go. As of October 2017 the original team have concluded work and handed the project over for continuation in a future TechLauncher project.

### Documentation

Now that the current team have concluded work, the most important source of documentation is the [Handover Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a). If you are interested in continuing the project then this is where you should begin.

### Source
The source code for the web app, RESTful API, Chinese Segmenter and information such as licensing, installation instructions and changelogs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/yugur). 

### Governance & other
Project development was managed through a publicly accessible [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jMzGDNag/yugur-dictionary-app) which contains most of our thought processes along the way. Note that while we have left the Trello board available for reference, the [Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a) contains a more succinct view of the project.

Beyond that documents such as meeting minutes and some legacy artefacts like early UI designs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByT4L7eSmJWtZXIwQV8xX2U2VFU).

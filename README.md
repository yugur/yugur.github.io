# Online dictionary

## About

The Yugur Online Dictionary is an open-source project aiming to build a dictionary targeted at the preservation and research of indigenous and endangered languages. The project is split into two main parts: a web app built with React and a RESTful API built with Go.

### Documentation

Now that the 2017 team has concluded work, the most important source of documentation is the **[Handover Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a)**. For anyone interested in assessing or continuing the project, it's recommended that you start here.

### Source

The source code for the web app, RESTful API, Chinese Segmenter and information such as licensing, installation instructions and changelogs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/yugur). 

### Tracking & other documents

Project development was tracked through a publicly accessible [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jMzGDNag/yugur-dictionary-app). Note that while the Trello board is still available for reference of who did what, the [Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a) contains a more succinct view of the project and its user stories. 

At this stage most documents of importance are included in the [Wiki](https://www.notion.so/yugur/Yugur-Dictionary-dc2b5c1dacc0431886fedb1b6803836a) however other artefacts such as meeting minutes are still located [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByT4L7eSmJWtZXIwQV8xX2U2VFU).
